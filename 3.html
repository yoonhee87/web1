    US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he is considering a trip to China, and is "cautiously optimistic" the United States can broker a trade deal with Beijing.
    "A trip is under consideration," Mnuchin told reporters at a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday. "I'm not going to make a comment on timing, nor do I have anything confirmed."
    On the sidelines of the IMF World Bank spring meeting, Mnuchin met with Yi Gang, governor of the People's Bank of China, where they discussed China's central bank, not trade, the secretary said.
